  {% blocktrans %}<em>Montréal-Python</em>
  <a href="http://montrealpython.org/" target="_blank">(montrealpython.org)</a>
  is a group for the users of the Python programing language in Montréal area.
  Our goal is to build a strong local community by putting
  together programmers, project leaders, artists and service
  providers.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}Our main event is the <em>Montréal-Python</em> mini-conference that occurs every 4 to
  6 weeks.  Every mini-conference last 2 to 3 hours in the evening; it
  features a number of quick 5- minute "flash presentations" and a main
  presentation that lasts from 45 to 60 minutes.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}All presentations are technical in nature and at least loosely
  related to the Python programming language <a href="http://python.org" target="_blank">(http://python.org)</a>.
  They include tutorials, demonstrations, success stories and general commentaries on the tools and aspects of the language.{% endblocktrans %}

<h1 class="pycon">
  {% trans 'PyCon 2014 and 2015' %}

<p>
  {% blocktrans %}In 2011 members of Montréal Python flew to Atlanta, Georia to
  attend PyCon — the premiere Python conference attended by over
  1,400 of the best Python programmers from companies around the
  world.  We placed a bid to bring PyCon to Montréal for 2014 and
  2015 and won with enthusiastic support from the Python Software
  Foundation.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}So from now up through then, the activities Montréal Python
  will enter into an international Python spotlight; both our own
  exposure and that of our sponsors will be tremendously
  amplified.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<h1 class="who">
  {% trans 'Who goes there?' %}
</h1>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}The audience is certainly technical; many top Montréal programmers will see
  each other at the events. Others are newcomers to the language or just
  generally geeky people who are interested in technology. The crowd contains
  several CTOs, lead developers and other strategic decision takers from both
  startups as well as other established IT organisations from the Montréal
  area.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}The number of people attending the <em>Montréal-Python</em> presentations is usually
  between 40 and 60 — with more people showing up at every event. Consistently,
  most of the attendees enjoy their time and come back event after event.{% endblocktrans %}

<h2>
  {% trans 'Faceted Sponsorship' %}
</h2>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}In addition to the "packaged" sponsorships listed below, we encourage
  sponsoring aspects of the meetups. For example, at each event we provide
  beverages and snacks for attendees, and, standard <em>Montréal-Python</em> tradition
  we all gather at a nearby pub for beers after the formal presentations.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}The standard process for faceted sponsorship is as follows: you propose the
  aspect you wish to sponsor as well as the amount you are willing to provide.
  The amount you sponsor will be adjusted by 30% to cover any additional
  costs; if you propose $100 for a round of drinks, you will be paying for $70
  of beers.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}Depending on the number of sponsors, we may set a minimum amount to ensure
  full supplies.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<h2>
  {% trans 'Custom Sponsorships' %}

<p>
  We're eager to work with you on ideas for "less conventional" sponsorships.  We
  are always happy to work with innovators and local leaders.
</p>
<p>
  If have a service or a product that can provide for the even, we'll evaluate
  you contribution and you will by entitled to the full privileges of the
  corresponding sponsorship level.  Interesting contributions could include
  gift certificates for your products, refreshments, technical books,
  consulting time, or audio-video equipment rental.
